# Things To Keep In Mind

->Directory to be uploaded must not any spaces in its name ("My_Photos" is allowed and not "My Photos").However files/directories within that may have spaces in their name(ex-> "My_photos/national park trip/" is allowed).

->While Downloading make sure you have twice the amount of free storage in your partition as the size of the folder to be downloaded.(If the folder to be downloaded is 10GB then make sure that your disk has atleast 20GB of free space.)

While Uploading make sure partition containing raw_path has as much free storage available as the size of the folder to be uploaded.(If the folder to uploaded is 10GB then make sure that you have an extra 10GB of free disk space available)

You may only upload a folder and not a file, If you want to upload a file move that file in an empty folder and upload that folder.
