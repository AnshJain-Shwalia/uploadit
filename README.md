Things to keep in Mind
[] Directory to be uploaded must not any spaces in its name ("My_Photos" is allowed and not "My Photos").However files/directories within that may have spaces in their name(ex-> "My_photos/national park trip/" is allowed).
[] While Downloading make sure you have twice the amount of free storage in your partition as the size of the folder to be downloaded.
[] While Uploading make sure partition containing raw_path has as much free storage available as the size of the folder to be uploaded.
[] You may only upload a folder and not a file, If you want to upload a file move that file in an empty folder and upload that folder.
